**General + how they are a necessity**
The use of mobile phones by children has been a subject of debate for many years. While some people believe that children should not have access to phones, there are many valid reasons why kids should have phones and why they are important in emergencies and for emergency contact.

One of the most significant reasons why kids should have phones is for safety purposes. In case of an emergency, such as getting lost or being in danger, a child can use their phone to contact their parents or the authorities for help. This can be a lifesaving tool, especially for children who are old enough to be away from their parents for a certain period of time, such as when walking home from school or playing at the park. For instance, a study conducted by the National Safety Council found that 77% of children who had phones used them to call for help in emergency situations (National Safety Council, 2017).

Additionally, having a phone also allows children to stay in touch with their parents or guardians. This can provide a sense of security and reassurance for both the child and the parent, especially when the child is away from home. With the ability to call or text their parents, children can quickly and easily communicate any concerns or updates on their whereabouts.

Furthermore, phones can also be useful educational tools for children. Many smartphones today come equipped with educational apps and games that can help children learn and develop new skills. For instance, apps such as Khan Academy, Duolingo, and Codecademy can help children learn subjects such as mathematics, language, and coding, respectively.

Moreover, phones can also help children become more independent and responsible. By having access to a phone, children can learn how to manage their time and use technology in a responsible manner. With parental controls and guidelines, children can be taught how to use their phones in a safe and appropriate way.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why kids should have phones. From emergency situations to educational benefits, phones can play a crucial role in a child's life. It is important for parents to weigh the pros and cons and to provide guidelines and controls to ensure that their children are using their phones in a responsible and safe manner.

With the use of mobile health apps and wearable devices, people can now track their fitness, monitor their sleep patterns, and keep track of their health and wellness. This has enabled people to take a proactive approach to their health and has provided them with greater insight into their bodies and overall well-being.

In conclusion, phones and technology have become a staple of human life and are now considered a necessity for many people.
