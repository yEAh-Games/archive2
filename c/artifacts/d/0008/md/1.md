You know what I really hate? Tangerines. Like honestly, they're just small oranges. And they aren't even any better! you're just paying for less of the same! And you still have to deal with peeling it! I would say that if they really wanted to make an orange variant that people would actually have a reason to buy, they should invest in peel-less orange research. Imagine, not having to peel an orange before eating it! wouldn't that be great? no struggle, no challenge, just sweet fruity goodness on a whim. I, for one, would definitely eat more oranges if I didn't have to peel them. It just makes your hands all sticky and orange smelling. Honestly, so annoying.
